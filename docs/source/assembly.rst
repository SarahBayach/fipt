Get necessary items
-------------------

-   3x M5x40mm hex socket bolts
-   3D-printed parts: (Typically: PLA, 250um layer height, 500um nozzle diameter) 

    - 071_0100_Base.stl (``base``)
    - 071_0101_Top.stl  (``top``)
    - 071_0102_Clamp.stl  (``clamp``)

-   20mm wide Kapton tape
-   >= 20mm wide double sided tape
-   2-3mm thick EVA foam rubber sheet (from arts and crafts store)
      

Assemble
--------

1.  Add foam to ``base`` and ``top`` in the pictures below. The foam parts consists of 3 layers: 
    -   Double sided tape
    -   Foam sheet
    -   Kapton tape 

2.  Make sure they are 20mm wide and that Kapton covers all foam (such that no electrolyte is absorbed).
3.  Screw two M5 into the ``base`` until they are flush at the bottom
4.  Screw one M5 through the middle of the ``clamp``

This is how the final result should look like:
